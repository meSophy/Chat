## Installation

First, as usual, you need to clone the project and install the requirements.

Then you have to set up the settings.
They are located at [project/settings](/project/settings). There are different setting files there.

You have to choose one of the [development](/project/settings/development.py) or [production](/project/settings/production.py) settings, depending on the situation.
You can do that by setting the [DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/settings/#envvar-DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE) environment variable.

In addition to these setting files, you need to create another one named "private.py" in the settings folder.
This file is for sensitive settings of your particular Django installation.
It should include:

1. [SECRET_KEY](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/checklist/#secret-key): A long, unique, and unpredictable value. You can learn how to generate one [here](https://humberto.io/blog/tldr-generate-django-secret-key/).
2. [DATABASES](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/#databases): You should create your database and add its settings here.
3. [ALLOWED_HOSTS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/#std-setting-ALLOWED_HOSTS): This isn't necessary for development, but in production, you have to list your domain names.
3. [TIME_ZONE](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/settings/#std-setting-TIME_ZONE): Additionally, you can set your time zone here.
